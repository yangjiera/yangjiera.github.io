<h2 class="post-title">GENIUS: Generative-Enhanced Next-generation Intelligent Understanding Systems</h2>
<p> <i> Lab Manager </i><br>
A collaboration between <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl">TU Delft</a>, <a href="https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl">Maastricht University</a>, <a href="https://www.dsm-firmenich.com/en/home.html">dsm-firmenich</a>, and <a href="https://kickstart.ai">Kickstart AI</a>, and the NWO Long-Term Programme ROBUST initiated by the <a href="https://icai.ai">Innovation Centre for Artificial Intelligence (ICAI)</a><br>

Lab duration: 2023-future <br>
<br>
Overview: "GENIUS is a research lab that seeks to extend and enhance state-of-the-art generative AI methods to support human experts in knowledge management and decision making, especially within large organisations. The lab focuses on how humans and AI can collaborate in knowledge management and decision making. It develops human-centred approaches that involve humans in extracting, organising and accessing stored knowledge and that support humans in those activities by taking into account relevant human characteristics such as needs and preferences. These methods and techniques are designed, developed, experimented with, evaluated and validated in a variety of contexts."

<h2 class="post-title">ANT: Embedded AI Systems and Applications</h2>
<p> <i> Scientific Coordinator </i><br>
Funded through the EU HORIZON-MSCA-DN-2023 (4.6 M&euro; | 17 PhDs) <br>
Project website: <a href="https://ant-dn.eu/" target="_blank"> https://ant-dn.eu/ </a> <br>
Project duration: 2025-2029 <br>
<br>
Overview: "AI in Embedded Systems is increasingly becoming part of our daily lives. From healthcare and agriculture to robotics and the Internet of Things, the applications are enormous. Currently, AI systems require a lot of processing power and therefore energy to run – making it challenging to run them efficiently on resource-limited devices, such as wearables. Besides, most AI models lack robustness and transparency, hindering trust and adoption on embedded devices. To tackle this, the EU's 2023 Horizon Europe Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions funded the ANT project to develop efficient, robust, and explainable AI solutions for embedded systems."

<h2 class="post-title">TACIT: Inclusive Technologies for
Access and Social Participation</h2>
<p> <i> co-PI </i><br>
Funded through NWO Perspectief<br>
Project website: <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/en/2024/ide/november/from-one-size-fits-all-to-design-for-social-inclusion" target="_blank"> https://www.tudelft.nl/en/2024/...</a> <br>
Project duration: 2025-2030 <br>
<br>
Overview: "From deaf people without access to sign language interpreters during medical appointments to visually impaired people unable to access the full richness of museum or library collections, even though disabilities are relatively common, those affected regularly encounter problems when trying to access or share information. Ultimately, this can lead to social inequality and exclusion. Ahead of the introduction of the European Union’s Accessibility Act in June 2025, TACIT is a new and unique research project aiming to change this."

<h2 class="post-title">Dutch Medical LLMs</h2>
<p> <i> co-PI </i><br>
Funded through NWO TKI-LSH<br>
Project website: <a href="https://www.health-holland.com/project/2025/2025/large-language-model-dutch-healthcare" target="_blank"> https://www.health-holland.com/...</a> <br>
Project duration: 2025-2029 <br>
<br>
Overview: "In the Netherlands, general practitioners (GPs) are essential for healthcare. However, GPs face overwhelming workloads, leading to stress, staff shortages, and reduced access to care. Our project unites experts from Erasmus MC, TU Delft, and AI startup Juvoly to develop a Dutch medical large language model (LLM) specifically designed to reduce administrative burdens for GPs. This innovation will improve GP well-being, enhance patient care, and set a new benchmark for AI in healthcare."

<h2 class="post-title">Delft Design@Scale AI Lab</h2>
<p> <i> co-Director </i><br>
A <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/ai/onderzoek-innovatie/labs-projecten">TU Delft AI Lab</a><br>
Lab website: <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/ai/design-at-scale-lab" target="_blank"> https://www.tudelft.nl/ai/design-at-scale-lab</a> <br>
Lab duration: 2021-future <br>
<br>
Overview: "We can harness unprecedented amounts of data using AI, creating opportunities to tackle major societal problems in areas such as health, well-being, and mobility. To make AI useful, we need to find new ways to combine the creative power of humans with the analytical capabilities of computers. That’s why the Design at Scale Lab (D@S Lab) is developing new methods for ‘Hybrid Intelligence’ (HI) – the combination of artificial and human intelligence."
