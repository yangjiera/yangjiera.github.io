Abstract:
Knowledge Creation (KC) is at the core of many types of information systems, ranging from community Q&A systems (e.g. Quora, StackOverflow), to content curation systems (e.g. Reddit, and forums), and to crowdsourcing systems (e.g. Amazon MTurk, CrowdFlower). Despite of the success of KC in some platforms, KC tasks so far are generally solved as a bottom-up process, where outcomes are heavily dependent on the spontaneous and autonomous contribution of users. This limits our ability to control the amount, speed, and quality of the generated knowledge. The unprecedented growth and availability of social data provides a great opportunity to systematically understand and model KC processes, while facilitating the design and validation of methods for their acceleration. This talk will present the results of our research, where we focus on mining social data for KC acceleration. We address the problem from three perspectives, respectively: 1) worker modelling; 2) KC task design; and 3) worker â€“ KC task matching. It will present a set of methods and tools that optimizes the corresponding part of the KC process, and the KC process as a whole. Empirical validation shows the efficacy of our proposed theory and methods in accelerating the KC process in a variety of domains, including online Q&A systems, crowdsourcing systems, and urban analytics systems.
