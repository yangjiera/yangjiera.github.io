  - name: CS4145 Crowd Computing
    description: Crowd computing studies how large groups of people can solve complex tasks that are currently beyond the capabilities of artificial intelligence algorithms, and that cannot be solved by a single person alone. The objective of the Crowd Computing course is to introduce the scientific and technical underpinnings of crowd computing, and to investigate how it can be used for computer science applications (e.g., information retrieval, machine learning, next-generation interfaces, and data mining) and for real world applications (e.g., cultural heritage preservation, online knowledge creation, smart cities, etc.)
