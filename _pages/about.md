# Brief Bio
<!--<img style="float: left;padding-right:3%" src="images/profile.jpg" width="35%">-->
I am an assistant professor in the [Web Information Systems](https://www.wis.ewi.tudelft.nl) (WIS) group at [TU Delft](https://www.tudelft.nl). I co-lead the [*Kappa*](https://www.wis.ewi.tudelft.nl/crowd-computing) research line on Crowd Computing & Human-Centered AI and co-direct the TU Delft AI Lab [Design@Scale](https://www.tudelft.nl/ai/design-at-scale-lab). Before, I was a machine learning scientist at Alexa Shopping, [Amazon Research](https://www.amazon.science), based in Seattle, and a senior researcher at the [eXascale Infolab](https://exascale.info), University of Fribourg - Switzerland. I received my PhD from TU Delft in 2017, MSc from TU Eindhoven in 2013, and BEng from Zhejiang University in 2011. During my master program, I also spent some time at [Philips Research](https://www.philips.com/a-w/research/home).

I work on *human-in-the-loop* approaches for trustworthy machine learning. The underlying assumption is that to create AI that really serves the purpose of people, it is of key importance to involve stakeholders in the design and development of new technologies throughout all stages of the machine learning lifecycle. My [research](project) contributes a new set of human-in-the-loop methods and tools for the development and evaluation of, and the interaction with, machine learning systems. With such efforts, my ultimate goal is to transform machine learning into an engineering discipline that gives humans the full control of AI such that it can be reliably and safely used in various contexts.
