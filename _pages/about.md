# Brief Bio
<!--<img style="float: left;padding-right:3%" src="images/profile.jpg" width="35%">-->
I am an Assistant Professor at the [Web Information Systems](https://www.wis.ewi.tudelft.nl) (WIS) group, [TU Delft](https://www.tudelft.nl). I co-lead the "kappa" research line on Human-Centered AI and Crowd Computing at the WIS group and the Delft AI Lab “Design@Scale” with colleagues from Design Engineering. Before, I was a Machine Learning Scientist at Alexa Shopping, [Amazon Research](https://www.amazon.science), based in Seattle, and a Senior Researcher at the [eXascale Infolab](https://exascale.info), University of Fribourg - Switzerland. I received my Ph.D. from TU Delft in 2017, M.Sc. from TU Eindhoven in 2013, and B.Eng. from Zhejiang University in 2011. During my M.Sc., I also spent some time at [Philips Research](https://www.philips.com/a-w/research/home).

I am interested in developing human-in-the-loop methods and tools for building reliable and trustworthy machine learning systems. I am passionate about making AI more "knowledgeable" and consider humans as an essential means to understanding the knowns and unknowns of intelligent machines, through human interpretation of machine behavior and human creation of knowledge. I also consider computational engines as essential tools to assist humans in large-scale knowledge reasoning, under uncertainty. My research is therefore both empirical and theoretical, with primary activities characterized by the design,  implementation, and analysis of human studies and algorithms. 
<!-- My work has received the [Douglas Engelbart Best Paper Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACM_SIGWEB#Hypertext_Douglas_Engelbart_Best_Paper_Award) by [ACM SIGWEB](https://www.sigweb.org) and the Best Paper Award from the [Trust in Crowd Work workshop](https://trustincrowdwork.west.uni-koblenz.de/home.html) at [ACM WebSci](https://www.webscience.org).
