# Brief Bio
<!--<img style="float: left;padding-right:3%" src="images/profile.jpg" width="35%">-->
I am an Assistant Professor at the [Web Information Systems](https://www.wis.ewi.tudelft.nl) group, [TU Delft](https://www.tudelft.nl). Before coming back to Delft, I was a Machine Learning Scientist at Alexa Shopping, [Amazon Research](https://www.amazon.science), based in Seattle, and a Senior Researcher at the [eXascale Infolab](https://exascale.info), University of Fribourg - Switzerland. I received my Ph.D. from TU Delft in 2017, M.Sc. from TU Eindhoven in 2013, and B.Eng. from Zhejiang University in 2011. During my M.Sc., I also spent some time at [Philips Research](https://www.philips.com/a-w/research/home).


My research focuses on human-centered machine learning for Web-scale information systems, aiming at leveraging the joint power of human and machine intelligence for understanding and making use of data in large-scale information systems. Over the past few years, I have worked on integrating human computation with model training in active learning, transfer learning, and weakly-supervised learning settings, to allow models to effectively and efficiently learn from small, sparse and noisy data. More recently at TU Delft, I am focusing on human-centered approaches for more interpretable and more reliable machine learning systems. 
<!-- My work has received the [Douglas Engelbart Best Paper Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACM_SIGWEB#Hypertext_Douglas_Engelbart_Best_Paper_Award) by [ACM SIGWEB](https://www.sigweb.org) and the Best Paper Award from the [Trust in Crowd Work workshop](https://trustincrowdwork.west.uni-koblenz.de/home.html) at [ACM WebSci](https://www.webscience.org).
