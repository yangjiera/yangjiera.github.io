<h3><i>"Building AI with people‚Äù</i></h3>

To build reliable and trustworthy AI, fundamental questions need to be answered including: what data do we need and how to collect high-quality data? how do machine learning models work and when do they fail? and how to evaluate the model from the stakeholders' and systemic perspective? To answer those questions, my research takes a human-in-the-loop approach that leverages human understanding of the task and the world, and that caters to the needs and desires of stakeholders. As contributions, my research creates a new human-in-the-loop methodology for machine learning, with a set of methods and tools for 
<li>Human-Enhanced Data Management: data <a href="/project.html/#OpenCrowd">creation</a>, <a href="/project.html/#Scalpel-CD">cleaning</a>, and <a href="/project.html/#Perspective">debiasing</a>;</li>
<li>Human-Centered Machine Learning: model <a href="/project.html/#SECA">explanation</a> and <a href="/project.html/#ARCH">debugging</a>;</li>
<li>Human-AI Collaboration: systemic <a href="/project.html/#ValuableML">evaluation</a> and <a href="/project.html/#ContiLearn">improvement</a>.</li>
<br>

My research methodology is both empirical and theoretical, with primary activities characterized by the design, implementation, and analysis of human studies, computational algorithms, and human-in-the-loop systems. I particularly value the collaboration with scientists from other disciplines and experts from various application domains, together with whom my <a href="people">research team</a> develop usable tools to make real-world impacts. 

<!--I am passionate about making AI more "knowledgeable" and consider human intelligence as an indispensable means to understanding the knowns and unknowns of intelligent machines, through human interpretation of machine behavior and human creation of domain knowledge. I also consider computational algorithms as a vital tool to assist humans in knowledge reasoning at scale, under uncertainty. My research methodology is therefore both empirical and theoretical, with primary activities characterized by the design, implementation, and analysis of human studies, computational algorithms, and human-in-the-loop systems.-->
