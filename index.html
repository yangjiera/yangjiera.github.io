<p>
I'm an Assistant Professor in the <a href="https://www.wis.ewi.tudelft.nl/">Web Information Systems</a> (WIS) group at the <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/en/eemcs/the-faculty/departments/software-technology">Department of Software Technology</a>, EEMCS faculty, TU Delft. I study human-centered computing for robust AI, with a focus on language technologies. I also co-lead <a href="https://www.genius-lab.nl">GENIUS</a>, an <a href="https://icai.ai">ICAI</a> lab (part of the national program LTP <a href="https://www.nwo.nl/en/researchprogrammes/knowledge-and-innovation-covenant/long-term-programmes-kic-2020-2023/robust-trustworthy-ai-based-systems-sustainable-growth">ROBUST</a>) dedicated to the development and use of Generative AI, and the Delft <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/ai/design-at-scale-lab">Design-at-Scale</a> AI lab, which explores AI for societal-scale challenges. Previously, I was a machine learning scientist at <a href="https://www.amazon.science">Amazon Research</a> in Seattle. <br />

<br />

Trained as a computer scientist, I'm fascinated by computational means to build intelligence. Practically, I'm interested in building robust intelligence that we can use and rely on in our daily work and life. I believe the critical path towards that is including humans in the computational processes grounded in social contexts. With that idea, I study the creation and operationalization of <a href="/research">human-centered computing</a> methods that leverage human conceptual and perceptual abilities&mdash;both to make machine reasoning interpretable and to align machine behavior with human values.
